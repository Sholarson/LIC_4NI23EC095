## A. DC Analysis
Let Iss be the current flowing throught Rss and Id1 & Id2 be the current flwowing throught NMOS 1 and 2.

**Finding Rd1, Rd2 and Rss**

Here,

P ≤ 2.8mW

We know that, P = VI, Iss = P/Vdd = 2.8mW/3.2V = 0.875mA

Therefore, **Iss = 0.875mA**

From the given parameters we can see that Vd1 = Vd2 = 1.7V (which is the Vocm) , Vg1 = Vg2 = 1.6V (which is the Vicm) and Vs1 = Vs2 = 0.6V (which is the Vp) we can
conclude that the MOSFET is symmetrical and hence Id1 = Id2.

So, Id1 = Id2 = Iss/2 = 0.4375mA

Then, Rd1 = Rd2 = (Vdd - Vocm)/Id1 = 3428Ω

And Rss = Vp/Iss = 685Ω

Also,

Vds = Vocm - Vp = 1.1V

Vgs = Vicm - Vp = 1V


**Hence, Iss = 0.875mA, Id1 = Id2 = 0.4375mA, Rd1 = Rd2 = 3428Ω and Rss = 685Ω**

**With Q-point (0.4375mA, 1.1V)**

## Procedure for simulation in LTSpice
1. Set up the circuit and give the value for the resistors based on the above analysis.
2. Go to the Spice directive for including the **tsmc018.lib** and write **".lib tsmc018.lib"**. **(Note that this library file should be on the same directory as your ltspice file)**
3. Now right click on the MOSFET and set the value of the channel length and width of the MOSFET as **L** and **W** respectively.
4. Let's set the value of L and determine the corresponding value of W where Id = 0.4375mA. In the SPICE directive, write **".param L 180nm"** to set the channel length to 180nm.
    Then, add another SPICE directive: **".step param W 1um 50um 1.5um"**, which sweeps the channel width (W) from 1µm to 50µm with a step increment of 1.5µm.
5. Click on the run icon and select the **"DC op pnt"**, you will see the co-ordinate plane which is blank. Now place your cursor on the wire near the drain and click on it.
   (This selected parameter should be current not the voltage). Now you will see the graph.
6. Right click on the graph and select **"Add_Traces"** the give the value of Id there i.e, 0.4375mA. Then trace the intersection of both the line by pressing **c** on your
   keyboard. On the popup window you will see the width of the channel which is **2.525µ.**
7. Now set the width and length of the MOSFET and remove **".step param W 1um 50um 1.5um"** and **".param L 180nm"**.
8. Then click on the run icon, you will get :-

Here we can see Id = 0.437353mA , Vds = 1.7-0.59 = 1.1V (Vds = Vd-Vs), Vp = 0.599172V and Vocm = 1.70076V ,which is approx. eqaul to the analysis we have done.

## B. Transient Analysis.
**Procedure for Transient analysis in LTSpice**
1. Remove the **".op"**.
2. Right click on the Vicm1 and select **"Advanced"**.
3. Then on the function select **"SINE"**.
4. Set DC offset = 1.6V, Amplitude = 50mV and Frequency = 1kHz.
5. Then click "ok".
6. Run the simulation by selecting **"Transient"** mode and setting Stop time as 5ms (Since freq = 1kHz, time period = 1ms and this 5ms simulation time allows you to capture 5 full cycles of the sine wave.
7. You will get:-

   <place the transient here>

Here we can see that the amplitude of the output waveform is 1.818528-1.7036 = 0.114875V. The input amplitude is 50mV so Gain, Av = -Vout/Vin = -0.114875V/50mV = -2.2975.
Therefore, **Gain,Av = -2.2975**.

## C. AC Analysis.
**Procedure for AC analysis in LTSpice**
1. Right click on the Vicm1 and on the Small signal AC Analysis set Amplitude = 1. (Amplitude = 1 is a standard practice because Gain, Av = -Vout/Vin and  Vin (AC Amplitude) = 1V, then
   Gain=Vout
2. Click on the run icon and select the AC Analysis mode.
3. Set Type of sweep = Decade, Number of points per decade = 20 and Start frequency = 1Hz and Stop frequency = 1THz.
4. Click "ok".
5. Then you will get :-

   <place the ac anlysis here>

## Second Circuit

![Alt Text](image/circuit_with_Iss.png)

## A. DC Analysis
Here current source Iss = 0.875mA is applied as Rss was setting Iss = 0.875mA using voltage division. 
Since a current source directly forces a specific current, it must match this value to maintain the same operating point.


**Finding Rd1, Rd2 and Rss**

Similarly as previous circuit,

at Iss = 0.875mA, P = 2.8mW

And, Id1 = Id2 = Iss/2 = 0.4375mA

Then, Rd1 = Rd2 = (Vdd - Vocm)/Id1 = 3428Ω

Also,

Vds = Vocm - Vp = 1.1V

Vgs = Vicm - Vp = 1V


**Hence, Iss = 0.875mA, Id1 = Id2 = 0.4375mA and Rd1 = Rd2 = 3428Ω**

**With Q-point (0.4375mA, 1.1V)**

## Procedure for simulation in LTSpice

Here we can see that the amplitude of the output waveform is 1.7812989-1.6991184 = 0.0821805V. The input amplitude is 50mV so Gain, Av = -Vout/Vin = -0.0821805V/50mV = -1.64361.
Therefore, **Gain,Av = -1.64361**.

## Third Circuit

![Alt Text](image/circuit_with_nmos.png)

## A. DC Analysis
In this circuit, an NMOS transistor (M3) is used in place of the current source (Iss) and resistor (Rss). However, to maintain the same operating point, 
the drain current of M3 must still be equal to Iss = 0.875mA.

Since the circuit remains symmetrical, the values of Rd1 and Rd2 remain unchanged at 3428Ω. This is because the same drain currents (Id1 and Id2) continue
to flow through the differential pair, and the voltage conditions remain the same.

Also,

Vds = Vocm - Vp = 1.1V

Vgs = Vicm - Vp = 1V

But we have to set the voltage Vg of M3 for drain current 0.875mA to flow. For this :-
1. Set up the circuit and give the value for the resistors based on the above analysis.
2. Set the voltage of Vg = {V}'.
3. Go to the Spice directive and write **".lib tsmc018.lib"** and **".step param V 0V 5V"**.
4. Now right click on the MOSFET, set the value of the channel length and width of the MOSFET same as previous circuit i,e L=180nm and W=2.525µ.
5. Then run the simulating in DC op pnt mode, a co-ordinate plane will popup now bring the cursor on the wire near the drain of MOSFET M3 and select the current.
6. On the graph right click, select **"Add Traces"** and give the value of the drain current of MOSFET M3 (0.875mA) there.
7. Use **"Place_Cursor on Active Trace"** using the cursor we find the intesection of this two line as 1.432V, which is the gate voltage Vg of MOSFET M3.
8. Set the Vg = 0.875mA for the M3 MOSFET.
9. Then click on the run icon, you will get :-

![Alt Text](image/dc_opt_pnt_with_nmos.png)


Here we can see Id = 0.437425mA , Vds = 1.70051-0.5991 = 1.1V (Vds = Vd-Vs), Id(M3)=0.874851V Vp = 0.5991V and Vocm = 1.70051V ,which is equal to the analysis we have done.

5. Then click "ok".
6. Run the simulation by selecting **"Transient"** mode and setting Stop time as 5ms (Since freq = 1kHz, time period = 1ms and this 5ms simulation time allows you to capture 5 full cycles of the sine wave.
7. You will get:-

![Alt Text](image/transient_nmos.png)

Here we can see that the amplitude of the output waveform is 1.7901093-1.6971968 = 0.0929125V. The input amplitude is 50mV so Gain, Av = -Vout/Vin = -0.0929125V/50mV = -1.85825.
Therefore, **Gain,Av = -1.85825**.

## C. AC Analysis.
